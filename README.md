## Heart Failure Prediction
This is a notebook project where I worked with a heart failure dataset.
The main goal was to practice feature engineering, preprocessing, and basic analysis to prepare the data for machine learning models.

#### Techniques I practiced:
Feature engineering (ordinal + one-hot encoding).
Data preprocessing with scikit-learn.
Visualization with matplotlib/seaborn.
Applying machine learning models.
Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
