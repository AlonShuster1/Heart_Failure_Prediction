# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project explores a dataset for heart disease prediction using feature engineering, data visualization, and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to preprocess data effectively, understand its patterns, and evaluate classification models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

---

## Project Objectives

- Perform **feature engineering** using statistical insights and encoding methods.
- Apply **Target Encoding** to improve categorical variable representation.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** for key insights.
- Train and evaluate **machine learning models** to predict heart disease risk.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Load the dataset** (heart disease data)
2. **Analyze statistics** of features to assess correlation and distribution
3. **Transform categorical features** using One-Hot Encoding
4. **Visualize distributions** to understand how features relate to the target
5. **Train classification models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
6. **Evaluate performance** using metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score

## üìä Sample Visualizations

Includes charts and histograms that help interpret patterns such as:
- Age vs. heart disease rate
- Cholesterol levels distribution
- Effect of different categorical variables on target outcome
